# APSurveyBot
Hi, I'm the official Discord bot for The AP Survey Project!

The AP Survey Project is a group-led effort to produce high quality, informative documents to help AP students across all subjects. 
We use input from seasoned students familiar with each AP course to identify new students' most frequently asked questions. We look for subjective quesitons, such as "what are the best resources?" and "how hard is this course?" Contributors then work with us to produce a comprehensive survey for each course, which we use to help answer those questions. We administer the survey to as as many past students as possible, and use the data to write high-quality answers in an official FAQ.

AP Survey Bot is our primary tool for gathering contributors. We use it to recruit server members, advertise the surveys that we use to collect data on all the AP courses, and distribute the finished FAQs to new students.

As part of our commitment to transparency and community involvement in the creation of these FAQs, the source code for AP Survey Bot is made available here, on Github. The development for this bot is done primarily by the project's administrative team. However, we still welcome feedback, so feel free to offer comments and suggestions in Discord related to the bot. If you are fluent in Java and have experience writing JDA driven Discord bots, you may make a pull request here and we'll review it in due time.

To join this project, find us on Discord through the AP Students Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/apstudents/
